# Introduction 

This is an ePortfolio showing three projects I worked on as my time as a computer science student. For each project I conduct a video narrated code review. I've then enhanced the projects based on the code review and the enhanced projects is what you'll find here. Finally at the end I include a professional self-assessment.

Each of the projects I've selected for the ePortfolio correspond to one of the following categories 
* [Software Design and Engineering](#software-design-and-engineering)
* [Algorithms and Data Structures](#algorithms-and-data-structures)
* [Databases](#databases)

# Software Design and Engineering

## Narrative

### Description and Background of Artifact

In my graphics programming class, our final project was to create a 3d scene using C++ and OpenGL. The scene I created is a laptop with two pole mounted external monitors on a desk. 

This assignment was a challenge for a variety of reasons. One was we weren't allowed to use useful external libraries like GLUT, which meant the shapes were created at a lower level by calculating the vertices, which includes the x,y,z, positioning, the x,y,z normals (for lighting), and the texture coordinates, as well as the indices for the vertices.

Although the assignment was difficult, I very much enjoyed the challenge.

### Justification for Artifact Inclusion

I think it’s good to have a C++ project in your ePortfolio due to the low-level nature of the language. Also, there’s quite a bit of math involved in the project so that helps display those abilities as well. Overall, this was one of the most difficult homework projects I’ve had so it makes a lot of sense to include it.

# Algorithms and Data Structures

## Narrative

### Description and Background of Artifact

A while back in my algorithms and data structures class we implemented multiple sorting algorithms and compared their speeds. We did this to learn about Big-O time complexity. This assignment was originally done in Python. For my update I’ve programmed it in JavaScript using NodeJS and made some updates to how the algorithms are written.

### Justification for Artifact Inclusion

The last artifact I’m including in my ePortfolio will be in Python, so having this be in JavaScript will show greater diversity of programming language ability. I also have further plans to elaborate on the Big-O reality of each sorting approach which an understanding of is a good skill to represent on my ePortfolio.

# Databases

## Narrative

### Description and Background of Artifact

It’s an interactive dashboard table with a pie chart and map below that are generated based on data stored in a MongoDB database. This was the final assignment in my CS-430 Client/Server Development class. The source data of the dashboard come from a  data source that the class provided called the Austin Animal Center Outcomes, which represents data on animals in Austin, TX animal shelters.

As part of the class, we mimicked creating this dashboard application on behalf of a group that wanted to identify dogs of the right characteristics for different rescue efforts. As such, I created queries for each rescue type that could be selected on the dashboard to update the results.

### Justification for Artifact Inclusion

The project represents NoSQL database usage via MongoDB. In the app there’s code for CRUD functionality. On the read function, the ability to perform complex querying based on front-end interaction is added. The pagination function I created I’m quite proud of and think it’s a good representation of my abilities.
Another reason is this project shows some web application experience which will be a big part of my software engineering career. Also, the other two projects are coded in C++ and JavaScript, so including of a python project shows greater language diversity.
